# Welcome to JavaScript Events!

During this tutorial, we are going to go over JavaScript Events:

1. onClick event.

2. Get values from event targets.

3. Change CSS properties with JavaScript when events trigger.

4. Waiting for the website to LOAD before doing anything (`onLoad` event).

5. Implementing a simple counter when the user clicks.
